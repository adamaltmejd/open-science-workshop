# Adam Altmejd's slides

Slides use [Reveal.js](reveal.js) and are available online at <https://adamaltmejd.se/slides>.

Because the revealjs R extension that works with Rmarkdown doesn't use the latest version and lacks some customization,
we instead only use `knitr` and then make use of Pandoc's built in revealjs-functionality with a custom template. To
build all `.Rmd` presentations in the folder, just run `make all`.
